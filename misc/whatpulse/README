WhatPulse is an application which monitors the number of keystrokes
and mouse clicks/movement. All of a user's keystrokes and mouse
statistics are pulsed and compiled into a nice view on whatpulse.org.

You'll need to add the group 'input' before installing this package.

You can optionally change the group name from 'input'.
WHATPULSE_GROUP=groupname ./WhatPulse.SlackBuild

Note: package naming has changed from 'WhatPulse' to 'whatpulse.' If the
system has the older version of WhatPulse installed, it must be removed
before installing this version.
