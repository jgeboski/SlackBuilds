Monitorix is a free, open source, lightweight system monitoring tool
designed to monitor as many services and system resources as possible.
It has been created to be used under production UNIX/Linux servers, but
due to its simplicity and small size you may also use it on embedded
devices as well.

DOCROOT can be set to override the default web directory of:
/var/www/htdocs/monitorix

This package requires: rrdtool
