WhatPulse is an application which monitors the number of keystrokes
and mouse clicks/movement. All of a user's keystrokes and mouse
statistics are pulsed and compiled into a nice view on whatpulse.org.

You'll need to add the group 'input' before installing this package.

# groupadd input

You must add any users you want to be able to use WhatPulse with to
the group 'input'.

# gpasswd -a username input

If do not want to restart to apply the udev permissions, you can run:
(Keep in mind this will apply read permissions for all users)

# chmod 644 /dev/input/event*

You'll need to have Qt installed.
