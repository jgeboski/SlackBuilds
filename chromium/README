Google Chromium is a browser that combines a minimal design with
sophisticated technology to make the web faster, safer, and easier.

Note:
Some processors don't have the SSE2 flag. Check it with:

   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i sse2

In this case you should disable sse2 when compiling chromium. Do this by
running the script as:

   NO_SSE2=1 ./chromium.SlackBuild

This requires libevent.
