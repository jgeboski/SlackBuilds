Minecraft is a sandbox building game where a player builds in a
world made of blocks. A player can destroy and place blocks to
create almost anything imaginable.

By default, this script allocates 1G of memory to java. To
increase the memory:

    # MEMORY=2G ./minecraft.SlackBuild

At runtime minecraft requires java (jre, jdk, or openjdk).
