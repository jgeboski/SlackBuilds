Pithos is a Pandora client for the GNOME Desktop. The official
Flash-based client is a CPU hog, and Pianobar is a great
reverse-engineered implementation, but is command-line only. Neither
integrate with the desktop very well, missing things like media key
support and song notifications.

Pithos requires: gst-python, python-distutils-extra,
                 gstreamer-plugins-bad with faad2,
                 gst-plugins-ugly
