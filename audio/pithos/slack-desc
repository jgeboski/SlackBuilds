# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pithos: Pithos is a Pandora client for the GNOME Desktop. The official
pithos: Flash-based client is a CPU hog, and Pianobar is a great
pithos: reverse-engineered implementation, but is command-line only. Neither
pithos: integrate with the desktop very well, missing things like media key
pithos: support and song notifications.
