The IcedTea browser plugin is a free and open source Java NPAPI
plugin that works in unison with OpenJDK. It supports implementations
of the Java programming language in the web browser via Java applets
and Java Web Start applications.

By default this script uses seamonkey-plugin to build the NPAPI based
plugin, however, this can be changed via:

  # MOZILLA_PLUGIN=mozilla-plugin ./icedtea-web.SlackBuild
