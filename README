These are some of my personal SlackBuilds that I have written and use.

There are several SlackBuilds that I have "forked" and modified. The
original author(s) of these SlackBuilds will most likely not support
my "forked" version.

If you are unsure of how to use these SlackBuilds, refer to the to the
HowTo on SlackBuilds.org:
