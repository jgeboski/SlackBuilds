The Opus codec is designed for interactive speech and audio
transmission over the Internet. It is designed by the IETF Codec
Working Group and incorporates technology from Skype's SILK codec
and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.  The Opus codec is designed to handle a
wide range of interactive audio applications, including Voice over
IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even remote live music
performances.
