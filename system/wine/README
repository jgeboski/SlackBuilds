Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.

If your video card does not support hardware-accelerated OpenGL, then run the
script like this:  OPENGL=NO ./wine.SlackBuild

NOTE: This will not build on a stock 64bit Slackware system, and we do not
      support doing so with 32bit-compatibility packages.  That doesn't mean
      that it won't work - we just don't support it at all.
