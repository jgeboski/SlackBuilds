Gnome15 provides a panel indicator (or applet), configuration tool,
macro system and plugin framework for the Logitech G series keyboards,
including the G15 and G19. The intention is to provide the best
integration with the Linux desktop possible, using the standard
protocols and libraries where appropriate.
