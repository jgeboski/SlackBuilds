Fake Xinerama is a replacement libXinerama library that instead
of querying the XServer reads ~/.fakexinerama and provides fake
information about Xinerama screens based on this file. It can be
used to fake a Xinerama setup even on computers with just one
monitor or to fake Xinerama setup other than one specified in
the XServer configuration.

Note, this package conflicts with libXinerama. libXinerama must be
uninstalled prior to installing this package.

Refer to Fake Xinerama's home page for configuration details:
